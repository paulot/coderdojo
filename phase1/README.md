Here we'll finish the setup for the sidebar. By the end you should have a sidebar that looks clean, personal and professional. You should:

* Add 2 backgrounds for the sidebar.
  * The first should be a black gradient with `0.7` opacity.
  * The second should be the image you decided to use for the sidebar.
* You should set the `font-family` of the sidebar to `Arial Helvetica, sans-serif`
* Position the sidebar `fixed` on the top left corner.
* Make it extend the full page and center vertically anything inside of it
* Refer to the project files for additional help.
