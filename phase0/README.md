Here we'll set up the basics for the workshop. You should create the basic directory structure having:
* A `css` folder to hold your stylesheets
  * The `css` folder should have a file named style.css which defines the styling for your website
* An `index.html` file which will hold the website.
  * The `index.html` file should define a `header` where the siderbar for the website will be located.
  * The sidebar should have a photo of you and a paraghraph about you
* An `images` folder to hold images for your website.
  * The `images` folder should have 2 images, one for the background, another of yourself
